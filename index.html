	<h1>FizzBuzz</h1>
	<p>In the original game of Fizz Buzz, you count from 1 to a given number (let's say 100). <br><br>For each number if it's not divisible by 3 or 5, you simply say the number. <br><br>If it's divisible by 3, instead of the number you say "fizz". <br><br>If it's divisible by 5, you say "buzz". <br><br>And finally if it's divisible by both 3 and 5, you say "fizz buzz". <br><br>So, counting from 1 to 15, you'd say: "1, 2, fizz, 4, buzz, fizz, 7, 8, fizz, buzz, 11, fizz, 13, 14, fizz buzz".</p>
